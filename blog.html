        <h1>Youtube problems</h1>
    <p>As the internet has reached a remarkable development, smartphones and relevant apps are not no longer unfamiliar, 
        making it less demanding to form a clip and sharing it on social patterns.<br> This shift has remained popular for a long time in foreign countries but the late import back to Vietnam is being well improved now. 
        In specific, when YouTube, the biggest video sharing site in the world pays producers through publicizing to include show advertisements on recordings to share it, more 
        individual users do it for money. <br>However, the other side of the coin is that many channels put their commercial benefit 
        above the humanities and start making disgusting jokes on their clips.</p>
    <p>The growing worry about the detrimental influence that trash YouTube channels are having on local Vietnamese youngsters throughout their adolescent years inspires me to create a project that promotes people's awareness of the dangers of ignoring them. 
        Children and teens' conduct nowadays is not as mature as in previous generations. It's easy to notice how an increasing number of individuals are changing their attitude toward everyday situations as a result of being negatively inspired by such channels. On the street, gangsters' lifestyles, deadly pranks, and foul language are most readily identifiable anecdotally. 
        Due to Vietnam's position in the top ten in YouTube viewership, those channels must be regulated in order to foster a more educated community.</p>

        <p>This is an example of dirty Youtube videos</p>
        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p>In conclusion, as more youngsters acquire access to open internet sources, YouTube has evolved from a video sharing platform to one of the most influential deceptive websites. <br>
            <strong>The awareness of parents must be increased in order to protect their children's mental innocence and teach them effectively. </strong>
            As a result, I've developed a desire to build supporting apps, which will be detailed below.
